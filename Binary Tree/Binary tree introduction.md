# Introduction
In this lesson, you will be introduced to Binary Trees and their implementation in Python.

    We'll cover the following
    - Depth of a Node
    - Height of a Tree
    - Types of Binary Trees 
       1. Complete Binary Tree
       2. Full Binary Tree
    - Implementation


A binary tree is a in which each node has , which are referred to as the Have a look at an elementary example of a binary tree:

Here is another example of a binary tree that introduces us to other related terminologies:

# Depth of a Node#
The length of the path from a node, n, to the root node. The depth of the root node is 0.

# Height of a Tree#
The length of the path from n to its deepest descendant. The height of the tree itself is the height of the root node, and the height of leaf nodes is always 0.

# Types of Binary Trees#

## Complete Binary Tree#
In a complete binary tree, every level except possibly the last, is completely filled and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.

## Full Binary Tree#
A full binary tree (sometimes referred to as a proper or plane binary tree) is a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.
